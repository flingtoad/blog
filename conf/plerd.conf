# This is a configuration file for a single Plerd-based blog!
#
# Update the values below to best suit your blogging needs. After that,
# you can then either copy (or symlink) this file to .plerd in your home
# directory for use as a system-wide default, or you can specify this
# file when running the `plerd` or `plerdwatcher` programs through their
# --config command-line option. (See these programs' respective man
# pages for more details.)

#####################
# Required setup
#####################
# Values for these fields are all required for Plerd to work properly.

# base_uri: The URI base that this blog will use when generating various
#           self-pointing links. Generally, this should be the same as your
#           blog's "front page" URL.
base_uri:     https://undermountain.net

# path: The path on your filesystem where Plerd will find this blog's
# source, docroot, and other important sub-directories. (If you don't
# want to keep all these under a single master directory, see
# "Split-location setup", below.)
path:        ./

# title: This blog's title.
title:        ⌊⌋ Undermountain Network

# author_name: The name of this blog's author.
author_name:  Mike Oliver

# author_email: The email address of this blog's author.
author_email: mike@undermountain.net

######################
# Social-media setup
######################
# Fill in these values in order to activate Twitter Card support for your
# Plerd-based blog.

# twitter_id: The Twitter username to associate with this blog.
#             If you define this, then Plerd will try to generate Twitter Card
#             metatags on each post's webpage.
#             (Don't include the leading '@', please.)
twitter_id: flingtoad

# image: Your blog's "logo", used as a fallback image for posts that do not
#        define an image themselves.
#        Optional, but if you don't define this, then posts without their
#        own image attributes won't get any social-media metatags.
image: http://blog.example.com/images/blog_logo.png

# image_alt: A text description of your image, equivalent to the "alt" attribute
#            in HTML <img> tags, and useful for visually impaired visitors to
#            your blog.
#            Optional, but if you define an image, you should define this too.
image_alt: "⌊⌋"

# Split-location setup
######################
# If you don't want to keep all of Plerd's required directories under a single
# master directory (configured withe the "path" directive, as seen above), then
# you can define the directories with these separate directives instead:
#
# source_path:      /home/me/Dropbox/plerd/source
# publication_path: ./docroot/
# template_path:    /yet/another/path/templates
# database_path:    /opt/plerd/db
# run_path:         /tmp/plerd/run
# log_path:         /var/log/plerd/
